    // Part of this is to be compatible to javascript

        // requires specifics.

        // A good example would be in wrapping a JSON parser. JSON
        // data can come in many different forms and the creator

        // The object myOtherAccount cannot be used until the type has

        // Never

        // Because TypeScript supports code flow analysis, the language
        // needs to be able to represent when code logically cannot
        // happen. For example, this function cannot return:

        const neverReturns = () => {
            // If it throws on the first line
            throw new Error('Always throws, never returns');
        };

        // If you hover on the type, you see it is a () => never
        // which means it should never happen. These can still be
        // passed around like other values:

        const myValue = neverReturns();

        // Having a function never return can be useful when dealing
        // with the unpredictability of the JavaScript runtime and
        // API consumers that might not be using types:

        const validateUser = (user: User) => {
            if (user) {
                return user.name !== 'NaN';
            }

            // According to the type system, this code path can never
            // happen, which matches the return type of neverReturns.

            return neverReturns();
        };

        // The type definitions state that a user has to be passed in
        // but there are enough escape valves in JavaScript whereby
        // you can't guarantee that.

        // Using a function which returns never allows you to add
        // additional code in places which should not be possible.
        // This is useful for presenting better error messages,
        // or closing resources like files or loops.

        // A very popular use for never, is to ensure that a
        // switch is exhaustive. E.g., that every path is covered.

        // Here's an enum and an exhaustive switch, try adding
        // a new option to the enum (maybe Tulip?)

        const stringOrNumber = getID(Math.random() < 0.5);

        // In this case above TypeScript can know the return value
        // instantly. However, you can use conditional types in functions
        // where the type isn't known yet. This is called a deferred
        // conditional type.

        // Same as our Dogish above, but as a function instead
        declare function isCatish<T>(x: T): T extends { meows: true } ? T : undefined;

        // There is an extra useful tool within conditional types, which
        // is being able to specifically tell TypeScript that it should
        // infer the type when deferring. That is the 'infer' keyword.

        // infer is typically used to create meta-types which inspect
        // the existing types in your code, think of it as creating
        // a new variable inside the type.

        //
        //  - this is a conditional generic type called GetReturnValue
        //    which takes a type in its first parameter
        //
        //  - the conditional checks if the type is a function, and
        //    if so create a new type called R based on the return
        //    value for that function
        //
        //  - If the check passes, the type value is the inferred
        //    return value, otherwise it is the original type
        //

        type getIDReturn = GetReturnValue<typeof getID>;

        // This fails the check for being a function, and would
        // just return the type passed into it.
